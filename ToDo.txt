Things I'd do in a real app:

	1.	Learn more on GraphQL and best practices dealing with it
	2.	Error handling
	3.	Loading handling
	4.	Form: verifications and “mandatory” representation (asterisk)
	5.	Using "mailto:" can cause security and spam issues. I would use server-side scripts instead
	6.	Add scroll for the list
	7.	Updating the list from server on any edit (i.e. new contact)
	8.	UX / Product stuff: 
	- edit, delete features. 
	- Better adaption for different screens sizes and shapes (need some basic design) 
	- Maybe add auto-close to the form on submit?
	9.	Might be useful to have some app-level state system: context or even redux/mobx. 
	Probably not worth to bother with right now, but if it is to develop into more complex app in the future - it might
