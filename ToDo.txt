Things I'd do in a real app:

	1.	Learn more on GraphQL and best practices dealing with it
	2.	Testing
	3.	Error handling
	4.	Loading handling
	5.	Form: verifications and “mandatory” represantation (asterisk)
	6.	Using "mailto:" can cause security and spam issues. I would use server-side scripts instead
	7.	Add scroll for the list
	8.	Updating the list from server on any edit (i.e. new contact)
	9.	UX / Product stuff: - edit, delete features. - Better adaption for different screens sizes and shapes (need some basic design) - Maybe add auto-close to the form on submit?
	10.	Might be useful to have some app-level state system: context or even redux/mobx. Probably not at this point, but if it is to develop into more complex thing
	11.	Browser comptabilty checks, more clean-up
